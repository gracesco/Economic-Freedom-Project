# Objective | 

The Economic Freedom Index tracks the advancements in global prosperity and shares patterns of success in over 180 countries.  Because of the global crisis we currently face, the most vulnerable have been made even more so.  By evaluating this data, we hope to find positive trends that can be shared with the United Nations’ Economic and Social Council.  Some of the relationships we intend to explore include:
* Fiscal Health of Countries/Regional Outliers(?) - Michael
* Tax Burden Percentage of GDP and Corporate/income tax Rate- Kara
* Unemployment compared to government Expenditure,  public debt, population - Grace
* Comparisons between various “freedoms” - Lisa

* Visualization analysis - the end user after you’ve already done the cleaning and editing. “What cool stories can I let the end user discover with this clean and beautiful data?”
* Data Queries - SQL - “ETL”
* Website for display - HTMl/CSS
* Create Visualizations
